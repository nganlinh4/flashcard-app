# Korean AI Flashcard App - Technical Plan

## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Flashcard Generation
- **Korean NLP Processing**: 
  - Use Korean NLP libraries (KoNLPy) for morphological analysis
  - Implement word frequency analysis to prioritize common words
  - Sentence segmentation for example sentences
- **Contextual Learning**:
  - Generate flashcards based on user's learning level
  - Adaptive difficulty adjustment
  - Thematic grouping (food, travel, business, etc.)

### 2. Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- **Custom SRS Implementation**:
  - Modified SM-2 algorithm with AI adjustments
  - Learning curve prediction using ML
  - Dynamic interval calculation
- **Performance Analytics**:
  - Retention rate tracking
  - Problem area identification
  - Progress visualization

### 3. Multimedia Learning
- **Image Generation**:
  - AI-generated images for vocabulary (DALL-E/Stable Diffusion)
  - Visual mnemonics creation
- **Audio Features**:
  - TTS for pronunciation (Google/Kakao TTS APIs)
  - Recording and comparison
  - Pitch contour visualization

### 4. Gamification
- **Achievement System**:
  - Daily streaks
  - Level progression
  - Badges for milestones
- **Challenge Modes**:
  - Timed recall
  - Fill-in-the-blank
  - Sentence construction

### 5. Social Features
- **Community Decks**:
  - User-generated content
  - Rating system
  - Collaborative editing
- **Leaderboards**:
  - Weekly challenges
  - Category-specific rankings

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services
